# Multiplayer Testing

The name of this project seems quite challenging to me, I know I have everything for the client nailed down for 2D purposes however, this is the second time I have dealt with server and clients and my first time using databases in Java, I want to make sure that every player's details are perfectly secure on my computer.

I might be overthinking for this project being quite the issue for me, but I just want to see how far I can get and learn; More about packets and servers. I know this project is very possible in Java.
