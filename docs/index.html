        War Gauge - Databases/Connections <font style="color: grey;">11/12/17</font>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I only have some basic terminology of how databases work, I need to, at some point, research more about software such as MySQL and using java with MySQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also need to research more about packets and connections in java, I feel like I have java.swing graphics down solid and for the GUI is great.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would love to start work researching more on both of these subjects however, I just have not had to time while completing what seems to be important work for school.

      <h2>
      <u>War Gauge - Release</u>
      </h2>
      <p>I have released a very early version of the game, probably not the normal way of how git-hub works, but anyhow, <a href="http://download1518.mediafire.com/ie4wotx9tbig/gb6hre14tvhqu4f/War-Gauge.zip">here</a>. I wouldn't click 'Join' otherwise you might give yourself a seizure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please make sure you have these dependencies before running the game:
        <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>
      <u>War Gauge - The Website Implementation</u>
      </h2>
      <p> I have just updated the website for the people who are interested in this project, I probably will not update this until some sort of release is available. I will only be updating my progress through Git-Hub repositories; this one is private unfortunately</p>
      <h2>
      <u>Idea's for War Gauge</u>
      </h2>
      <p>
      	War Gauge is meant to test and experiment with multiplayer connections with also allowing me to have some sort of experience and knowledge for developing multiplayer games in the future, I think War Gauge is not going to be perfect, there is going to be imperfections such as bad code.
      </p>
      <p>
      	My original thoughts and goals for this project was to get some sort of login and register system going, this includes secure databases, encryption, configuration file reading, deployable servers, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
      	I will be making a 2D platformer, you and the people inside one server have to survive the waves of zombies, or you can play solo with your own server either way. There will be drops from around the maps and zombies. The graphics are very 8-bit like, this is to both speed up graphic developing and maintaining a nice look.
